What Information Do We Collect?
</h3>
<p>
The information we gather enables us to personalize,
improve and continue to operate the Services. In connection
with certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect,
use, share, and/or display some of your Personal Information. We
collect the following types of information from our users.
</p>
<h4 class="ui header">Account Information:</h4>
<p>
When you create an Account, you will provide information, such as your

Facebook in accordance with Facebook’s policies and your preferences selected
through Facebook. We may use your contact information to send you information
about our Services, when we feel such information is important. You may

we reserve the right to contact you even if you unsubscribe when we believe

</p>
<h4 class="ui header">User Content:</h4>
<p>
Some features of the Services allow you to provide content to the Services,
such as written comments. All content submitted by you to the Services

this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h4 class="ui header">Information Collected Automatically:</h4>
<p>
We automatically receive and record information from your device or
web browser when you interact with the Services. This information

and to otherwise personalize, improve and continue to operate the Services.
</p>
<p>
Generally, the Services automatically collect usage information, such
as the number and frequency of visitors to the Sites or mobile application.
We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure.
This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us
to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that we
can analyze and improve them.
</p>
<h4 class="ui header">

or email or social media accounts that you use to share our content.
</p>
<p>

decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways.
</p>
<h4 class="ui header">Aggregate Information:</h4>
<p>We collect statistical information about how both unregistered and
registered users, collectively, use the Services (“Aggregate Information”).

</p>
<div class="ui hidden divider"></div>

</p>
<h4 class="ui header">Public Information about Your Activity on the Services:</h4>
<p>
Some of your activity on and through the Services is public by default.

</p>
<p>

In addition, Information concerning the use of the Services (such as what pages they

other automated data collection means, and stored by us.
</p>
<p>
Please also remember that by choosing to provide Personal Information using

</p>
<h4 class="ui header">
IP Address Information:
</h4>
<p>
While we collect and store IP address information, that information is not made

in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h4 class="ui header">Aggregate Information:</h4>
<p>
We share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and other persons

<h4 class="ui header">
Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers:
</h4>
<p>
In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user
information, including Personal Information, is typically one of the transferred business
assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out
of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is
transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur.
Following the transfer of user information in the circumstances described in this paragraph,
all inquiries concerning the processing of user information should be directed to the entity
to which the information is transferred.
