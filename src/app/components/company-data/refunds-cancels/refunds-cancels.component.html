<p>
At Metdine, we try to ensure 100% satisfaction for our registered users.  We always
recommend our buyers review the menu in detail before they place an order, thus lowering
the chances of cancellation.  If a buyer isnâ€™t satisfied with the delivered food, we will
refund the full amount paid for the food, provided the user submits a request for refund
(with or without reasons) within thirty (30) days of the date of payment. Our procedure
for the refund will be as follows:

Request for Refund
</h2>
<p>
For all refunds, please send an email to <a href="mailto:ops@metdine.com">ops@metdine.com</a> within thirty (30) days of the date
of payment. Requests for refunds received later than thirty (30) days after the date of payment
will not be processed.
